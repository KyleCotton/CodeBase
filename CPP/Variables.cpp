//Using a Variable

#include <iostream> 	//States the header you want to use
			//Using 'iostream' as the file system needs to be used

using namespace std; 	//Defines the name space, useful for large programs
			//Helps with compiler eficency

int main()
{
	int length;	//Defines a variable as a integer
	length = 7;	//Assigns a value to the variable

	cout << "The lenght is ";
	cout << length;
	cout << "\n";
	return 0;
